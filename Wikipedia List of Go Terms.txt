<p>The closest English one could use is 'latent potential.' From the Japanese term <i>aji</i> (<span class=""t_nihongo_kanji""><span lang=""ja"" title=""Japanese language text"">味</span></span>), meaning taste, it refers to played stones' lingering ability to open various avenues of play. Though not all <i>aji</i> is pursued or taken advantage of, it bears on the course of the game. Good <i>aji</i> is when your groups are strong, and have little or no possibility of being compromised. Bad <i>aji</i> is when dead stones or weaknesses in one's own formation carry a latent threat of compromising an existing area should the situation become ripe. <i>Aji</i> is different from a simple defect or weakness in that it can be exploited and/or repaired in multiple ways at multiple stages of the game and the best way or time is not immediately clear; hence the ""aftertaste"" metaphor.

The word 'atari' is used in Japanese when a prediction comes true or when someone wins a lottery. In Chinese: <i>dǎchī</i> (<span lang=""zh"" title=""Chinese language text"">打吃</span>); Korean: <i>dansu</i> (<span lang=""ko"" title=""Korean language text"">단수</span>). Atari is a term used in Go for a situation where a stone or chain of stones has only one <a href=""#Liberty"">liberty</a>, and may be captured on the next move if not given one or more additional liberties. It can be a verb for the act of placing a chain under <i>atari</i>, as well as an adjective to describe the status of a unit, as being ""in (the state of) <i>atari</i>"". Calling out <i>atari</i> during a game is sometimes done by beginners much like calling out <i><a href=""/wiki/Check_(chess)"" title=""Check (chess)"">check</a></i> in chess, but it is considered rude by many more advanced players.<sup id=""cite_ref-3"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-3"">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup>

<p>Above is a simple <i lang=""ja-Latn"" title=""Japanese-language romanization""><i>atari</i></i> formation with only one stone (the white triangled stone) in danger of being captured.

<p>A divine move is a truly inspired and original move: one that is non-obvious and which balances strategy and tactics to turn a losing game into a winning game. A divine move is singular—they are of such rarity that a full-time Go player might play a single such move in a lifetime. The term comes from the <a href=""/wiki/Japanese_language"" title=""Japanese language"">Japanese</a> <span class=""t_nihongo_kanji""><span lang=""ja"" title=""Japanese language text"">神の一手</span></span> <i>Kami no Itte</i>, meaning ""move of God"" or ""Godly move"".
</p><p>The Divine Move is used in Go teaching as a motivation to look again at positions in games and consider not just the obvious moves but the less obvious and more innovative as well, in particular <i>tesuji</i>.
</p><p>
An example of such a divine move might be the so-called <a href=""/wiki/Ear-reddening_game"" title=""Ear-reddening game"">ear-reddening move</a> played by <a href=""/wiki/Hon%27inb%C5%8D_Sh%C5%ABsaku"" title=""Hon&#39;inbō Shūsaku"">Hon'inbō Shūsaku</a> in 1846.

<p>Eyes are internal, fully surrounded liberties of a group of stones. An eye cannot be filled by the opponent until all of the group's other liberties have been filled.
</p><p>The presence or absence of eyes in a group determine <a href=""/wiki/Life_and_death"" title=""Life and death"">life or death</a> of that group: A group with one or no eyes will die unless its owner can develop them; conversely, a group with two or more eyes will live since an opponent can never reduce the group down to a single liberty.
</p><p>Eyes are counted as occupied territory of the group that fully surrounds the eye. When a group shares (is adjacent to) one or more eyes with the opposing player's groups, those eyes do not count as territory for either player. Sometimes those eyes are reduced to <a href=""#Dame"">dame</a> as other areas of the board change to give one or both groups additional eyes, allowing one or both players to fill the shared eyes. But sometimes those shared eyes do not resolve (see <i><a href=""#Seki"">seki</a></i> below).

<h3><span id=""Gote.2C_sente_and_tenuki""></span><span class=""mw-headline"" id=""Gote,_sente_and_tenuki"">Gote, sente and tenuki</span><span class=""mw-editsection""><span class=""mw-editsection-bracket"">[</span><a href=""/w/index.php?title=List_of_Go_terms&amp;action=edit&amp;section=9"" title=""Edit section: Gote, sente and tenuki"">edit</a><span class=""mw-editsection-bracket"">]</span></span></h3>
<p>A move that overwhelmingly compels a player into a particular follow-up move is said to have ""sente"" (<span class=""t_nihongo_kanji""><span lang=""ja"" title=""Japanese language text"">先手</span></span>), or ""initiative""; the opponent has ""gote"" (<span class=""t_nihongo_kanji""><span lang=""ja"" title=""Japanese language text"">後手</span></span>). In most games, the player who maintains sente most of the time will win.
</p><p><i>Gote</i> means ""succeeding move"" (lit: ""after hand""), the opposite of <i>sente</i>, meaning ""preceding move"" (lit: ""before hand""). <i>Sente</i> denotes which player has the initiative in the game, and which moves result in taking and holding the initiative. More precisely, as one player attacks in <i>sente</i>, the other defends in <i>gote</i>, it can be said that they respectively do and do not have the initiative. The situation of having <i>sente</i> is favorable, permitting control of the flow of the game.
</p><p>Applying these concepts to a whole sequence is basic to higher strategy. If Black starts a sequence that properly ends in an even number of plays, Black retains <i>sente</i> in doing this. If Black starts a sequence that properly ends after an odd number of plays, Black loses <i>sente</i> and takes <i>gote</i>. Accepting <i>gote</i> should only be in return for some profitable exchange. Correct play in the <a href=""/wiki/Go_terms#Yose"" class=""mw-redirect"" title=""Go terms"">yose</a> (endgame) can consist of playing available <i>sente</i> sequences, and then taking the largest <i>gote</i> sequence on the board, though that description is a simplification. A <i>reverse sente</i> play is a special type of <i>gote</i> play, preventing the opponent from making some <i>sente</i> move. The relative value of reverse sente plays depends on the overall position, but one can count it as twice the value of what it would be if purely gote.
</p><p>A player has <i>sente</i> if he does not currently need to respond to moves made by his opponent. This can be achieved by <i>tenuki</i> (ignoring the opponent), as a kind of gambit. A player can break out of <i>gote</i>, and gain <i>sente</i> by choosing to accept some future loss on the local level, in order to take the initiative to play elsewhere.
</p><p>In the case that neither player directly responds to the other's moves, the game can become difficult to analyze.  Though each player has <i>gote</i> on entering the turn, the move itself is <i>sente</i>. Such games often end in large exchanges, or one player will be shown to have a weaker position and eventually have to answer to avoid heavy damage.

<p><i>Jōseki</i><span style=""font-weight: normal""> (<span lang=""ja"" title=""Japanese language text"">定石</span>)</span> are established sequences of play which (locally speaking) are considered to give an optimal result (balanced exchanges and/or equal territories/influences) to both players.

</p><p>Often joseki are played out early in the game and involve dividing the corners. There are also ""mid-game joseki"", dealing with for example an invasion into a common enclosure or framework.
</p><p>Though joseki have some parallel with <a href=""/wiki/Chess_opening"" title=""Chess opening"">chess openings</a>, they differ significantly. Chess openings structure the whole board while joseki deal only with a local position. Therefore, the choice of which joseki (of many possible) to play in any given situation should be based on an assessment of the global position. This includes considerations of the direction of play, current balance of territory and influence, and one's own game strategy.
</p><p>It is also quite possible to deviate from joseki and obtain a good result if the surrounding position allows. In other words, <i>joseki</i> are sensitive to the context in which they are played.

</p><p>In the context of Go, kiai (<span class=""t_nihongo_kanji""><span lang=""ja"" title=""Japanese language text"">気合い</span></span>) often translates as ""fighting spirit"", i.e. aggressiveness or initiative, but not unthinking greed. Kiai means keeping <b>sente</b>, that is not letting the opponent have his or her way. A <a href=""/wiki/Sensei"" title=""Sensei"">sensei</a> might say, ""You play too passively — put some kiai in your moves!” A passive player may follow an opponent around the board responding to each move in turn. Kiai moves are the opposite of passive or submissive and a player showing kiai will dictate the flow of play. Kiai moves can catch an opponent off-balance and turn the game around. Examples of kiai moves include snatching sente away from the opponent; defending with a move that also counter-attacks; or answering a <b>kikashi</b> (forcing move) in an unexpected way.
Kiai is also a term used in Japanese <a href=""/wiki/Martial_arts"" title=""Martial arts"">martial arts</a>, usually as a name for a loud yell accompanying an attack. Obviously this is outwardly more restrained in the context of a board game, but it is intended to be in the same spirit.

<p>Literally meaning 'an enlivenment', Kikashi (<span class=""t_nihongo_kanji""><span lang=""ja"" title=""Japanese language text"">利かし</span></span>) is a forcing move, usually one made outside the primary flow of play. Unlike <i>sente</i>, though, a move is <i>kikashi</i> when it yields a high efficiency in play by forcing the opponent to abandon a course of action.  A <i>kikashi</i> stone will usually be sacrificed while conferring an advantage; for example, the <i>kikashi</i> stone could act as a ladder breaker or destroy the opponent's potential eyeshape, while the answering move has no value at all.<br />Moves can be <i>kikashi</i>, or not, depending on whether they are answered with appropriate sophistication or not.

The Ko rule states that a stone cannot be laid such that it makes the board look exactly the same as it did at the end of the player's last move. Commonly, this means that if a lone stone is captured, the next player cannot respond by laying a stone in the same location as the captured stone if so doing will merely cause the opponent's last played stone to be captured. This would make the board look as it did two plays ago, and could be repeated indefinitely, which is why such play is forbidden.
</p><p>A player may take advantage of the Ko rule by playing a stone with the knowledge that the opponent will not be permitted to replace the captured stone in the immediate responding move. If the same play is still available in a subsequent turn, the play is not forbidden and the Ko advantage is reversed. This kind of back and forth is allowed because the game is still developing elsewhere on the board in the interim.

<p><i>Miai</i> (<span class=""t_nihongo_kanji""><span lang=""ja"" title=""Japanese language text"">見合い</span></span>) in Go are, in the simplest terms, a pair of vacant points on the board that are equivalent in value. For example, if Black plays at <i>A</i>, White can play at <i>B</i> and suffer no disadvantage from the exchange.
</p><p>This occurs often. <i>Miai</i> can be seen in the <i><a href=""/wiki/Fuseki"" title=""Fuseki"">fuseki</a></i> stage on a large scale, or in a simple <a href=""/wiki/Life_and_death"" title=""Life and death"">life and death</a> problem, such as a straight four-space eye.

<p>A monkey jump is a move, usually used in the end-game, which can reduce one's opponent's territory significantly. It can be played when the attacker has a strong stone on the second line and the defender has no nearby stones on the first or second line guarding his hoped-for territory. The attacker places a stone on the first line three spaces into the defender's territory from the strong stone. Due to the special properties of the edge of the board, the defender cannot usually cut off the stone.

<p><i>Shape</i> is the configuration of stones in their flexibility and efficiency at staying connected, forming eyes, and maintaining liberties. Stones are said to have <i>good shape</i> if they are efficient and flexible, or <i>bad shape</i> if they are inefficient. Classic examples of good shape are the <b>ponnuki</b> (four stones in a diamond created by capturing an enemy stone) and the <b>bamboo joint</b> (a 2x3 pattern of two stones, two spaces and two more stones). Examples of bad shape are the <b>empty triangle</b> (three adjacent stones forming an 'L') and the <b>dango</b> (large clump of stones not containing any eyes).  Joseki is, in large part, the study of forming good shapes with the stones.

<p><b>Thickness</b> is a literal translation of the Japanese word <i>atsumi</i><span style=""font-weight: normal""> (<span lang=""ja"" title=""Japanese language text"">厚み</span>)</span> and connotes the position of power and impregnability conferred by the thickness of medieval castles' stone walls.  A group is thick when it has developed beyond the level of stability in its local area without accruing significant weaknesses, and consequently projects power at a distance, especially over vacant or unsettled areas of the board.  Such positions have a profound influence on the flow of the game.  In the diagram, though white has about 10 points of territory in the corner while black has little or none, black can expect the power projected outward by his thick position to more than make up for this.<sup id=""cite_ref-9"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-9"">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Note that his result would not be as good if white had a settled position in the direction black's influence is facing.

<p><i>Yose</i><span style=""font-weight: normal""> (<span lang=""ja"" title=""Japanese language text"">ヨセ</span>)</span> is a term used in connection with Go endgame plays. From the Japanese, a <i>yose</i> would mean a <i>tightening play</i>, relating strictly to a play on the board that consolidates territory or destroys the opponent's territory. It is not, properly speaking, synonymous with the <i>endgame phase</i> as a whole but it is often used that way in both Japan and the West.<sup id=""cite_ref-sensei_yose_10-0"" class=""reference""><a href=""#cite_note-sensei_yose-10"">&#91;10&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>A fundamental skill in the endgame is the ability to evaluate plays in different areas of the board and identify which plays have priority. This usually depends on <i>counting</i>: determining the number of points at stake. Knowledge of counting begins with some simple examples and heuristics. <a href=""/wiki/Combinatorial_game_theory"" title=""Combinatorial game theory"">Combinatorial game theory</a> has been implicated in gaining actual proofs rather than practical ways to win positions.
</p><p><i>Oyose</i>, or large <i>yose</i>, is a term often used in English language literature. It can be used for a <i>yose</i> that is large enough to be hard to count with precision (say, 20 points or more). It may also be used to refer to the <i>early endgame</i> phase of the game, immediately after middlegame combat, in which the typical <i>yose</i> plays are substantial but were neglected due to pressure elsewhere.

</p><p><span class=""t_nihongo_kanji""><span lang=""ja"" title=""Japanese language text"">様子</span></span> (<i>yōsu</i>) means situation or the state of things, and <span class=""t_nihongo_kanji""><span lang=""ja"" title=""Japanese language text"">見る</span></span> (<i>miru</i>) is ""to see"", thus ""yōsu o miru"", to ""see how things stand"". In Japanese this expression is usually used to say that it's better to wait and see before taking an action (e.g. ""shibaraku yōsu o miru beki da"", it's better to wait and see for a little while).
